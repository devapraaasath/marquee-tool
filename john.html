            Krrr, Amadou!
            Your time is up, my time is now, now
            You can't see me, my time is now, now
            It's the franchise, boy, I'm shining now, now
            You can't see me, my time is now, now
            In case you forgot, I fell off
            I'm still hot knock your shell off
            My money stacked fat
            Plus I can't turn the swell off
            The franchise doing big business
            I lie this, it's automatic
            I win this, so, you hear those horns, you finished
            A soldier
            And I stay under you fighting
            Plus I'm storming on you chumps
            Like I'm thunder and lightning
            Ain't no way you breaking me kid
